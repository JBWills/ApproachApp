Approach
========

Approach is a locative, audio based art app for iOS. This code provides an easy to use and modify path tool that allows the user to play audio while walking along a path. It includes a marker that properly moves along the path based on where the user "should" be walking.

Approach:
- Uses the Google Maps API for iOS
- Requires iOS 6 and above

Abstract:
Too often a single story dominates a space, defining what counts as credible while excluding diverse voices. Approach layers information on a site, allowing users to choose a path and listen to multiple stories and found sounds that might otherwise be unavailable. Institutions adopting the app will curate stories and sounds that capture diverse ways of perceiving a space. Approach meets the challenges facing the future of information by providing an opportunity for people from different cultures to understand each other’s experiences of a shared space. Approach creates not just an archive of overlapping sounds and memories, but an experience that encourages users to live seemingly unremarkable spaces in a new way. This site-specific mobile mobile art-app does not just offer an opportunity to contemplate difference, but expands who shapes the story of a space. Everyone’s voice counts. Every path should be walked.

How to use this code:

1. Get an API Key for Google Maps: https://developers.google.com/maps/ios-access

2. Paste the key in the FakeDataBase.m file where it says "Your-Key-Here"

3. Import your own audio to the app

4. Replace the placeholder audio file names with audio you imported

NOTE: the paths placed in the code are only there to show you how they should be formatted, if you want to add your own path, just delete what I have and place your own encoded path, audio title, format, path title, path description, and path color into the FakeDataBase.m file. To make your own encoded path, use this utility: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility
